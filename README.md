## Skate Board 

### Description 

Our very first onshape assignment in which we followed a very detailed set of insturctions to create a skate board

### Process

The First thing we did was make the board. It was just a rectangle with some fillets. Then we put some holes in the board and used those holes to make truck base plate, bushing and truck hanger (truck is just the name of the part its not for a truck or looks like a truck {though a larger version of it might be used in trucks}). After that we made a seperate parts studio for the wheel and bearing. The wheel used a revolution extrude and the bearing was based off the wheel. Finally we made an assembly and tossed all the parts into it. We used mates to attach evberything together and added in a special screw to make it look more professional
