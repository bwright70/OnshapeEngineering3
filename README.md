## Skate Board (Board)

### Description 

Our very first onshape assignment in which we followed a very detailed set of insturctions to create a skate board

### Process

The First thing we did was make the board. It was just a rectangle with some fillets. Then we put some holes in the board and used those holes to make truck base plate, bushing and truck hanger (truck is just the name of the part its not for a truck or looks like a truck {though a larger version of it might be used in trucks}). After that we made a seperate parts studio for the wheel and bearing. The wheel used a revolution extrude and the bearing was based off the wheel. Finally we made an assembly and tossed all the parts into it. We used mates to attach evberything together and added in a special screw to make it look more professional

### Useful Tips 

#### The Deck
* You can use the Rectangle to define the diameter of the circles 
* Mirroring a Sketch means you don't have to dimention things twice or make a whole bunch of relation ships 
#### The Trucks 
* Offsetting allows you to create shapes a center distance from another so you can define your sketch based on previous designs 
* You can use other parts of previous designs, but unless you want them in your new sketch, make sure they are conbstructions 
* When Extruding you can change it to New instead of Add and the extrude will make a new part.
#### Wheels and Bearings 
* You only have to make one Bearing because when you assemble it you can just drag a new one in
* Make sure your bearing is a New part and not a part of the wheel. 
#### Assembly 
* You can just drag in multiples of the parts you only made one of. 
* You can select several parts and copy them then when you paste them all the mates between the parts will remain
